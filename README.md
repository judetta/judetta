I'm a junior frontend developer working with Angular to build the coolest energy and sustainability management solution on the market.

I also play with React, Node.js, Python and whatever interesting drops on my way.

I love... \
 💡 developing ideas into functionalities \
 🔗 solving puzzles \
 ✅ getting things done \
 🎨 creating something beautiful and functional 

👉🏻 Here you'll find some small projects that I do for practice and for fun, maybe also some actually useful stuff.
